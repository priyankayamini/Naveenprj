                        <p class="text-dark para"> The idea of starting a Society of Midwives in India took shape towards the end of the Safe Motherhood Decade. In India, midwifery existed alongside nursing, and was not perceived as a separate profession either during training or practice, though evidences showed that one of the main factors contributing to reduction of MMR in many countries was the efficient use of midwives. During this period Dr. M. Prakasamma was involved with several research, training and intervention projects on maternal health including training of ANMs and TBAs which strengthened her conviction that safe motherhood can be achieved only of skilled midwives attended every pregnant woman during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal periods. Dr. M. Prakasamma discussed these within the Country and during her presentations at the FIGO World Congress at Copenhagen (1997), Inter Agency Group’s Safe Motherhood Consultation at Colombo (1997), ICM Regional meeting in Delhi ( February 1998), and 25th ICM Congress at Manila (1999). Discussion were head with interested nurses and a Midwifery Group was started (February, 1998) at the Academy for Nursing Studies ( ANS) in Hyderabad.</p>

                        <p  class="text-dark para"> The launching of the Indian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery in May 1998 (International Year of Safe Motherhood) provided a medium for expression and exchange among interested professional. The Midwifery Group helped to put together a special issue of the IJNM in December 1998 with focus on midwifery. Through the journal, an invitation was sent to nurse-midwives in the Country to join the proposed Society of Midwives.  Letters expressing eagerness to join the Group started arriving. By common consensus an Executive body consisting of Dr. M. Prakasamma, Bandana Bhattacharya, Champa Dutta, Alamelu Raman and Ameena Begum was formed (Later Ameena expressed inability to continue and Mrs. Padma was nominated in her place). The Academy for Nursing Studies provided space and support, and initiated the proves of registering the Society.</p>

                                                            The midwifery Group has started advocacy, information dissemination, and networking for strengthening midwifery services in the country with the goal of leading women in childbirth towards safe motherhood.
                                                            With this ambitious goal, it has been decided to start a Society of Indian Midwives.
                                                            All nurses who have an interest in midwifery either because they are working in this area or because of higher qualifications in this field are invited to join the Society of Indian Midwives.
                                                            The objective of this Society is to form a focus group on midwifery to discuss and deliberate on midwifery issues and to collaborate with national and international agencies working in the area of midwifery for safe motherhood.</p>

The IJNM started a one-page newsletter on the front inner cover to disseminate news about the progress of the Society. Five such newsletters were released communicating latest development related to membership and activities. As interest among nurses grew and number of members increased, The Academy for Nursing Studies requested UNICEF to support a meeting of key nurse midwives and members of the Midwifery Group. This meeting was  held at UNICEF, New Delhi on 24th March 2000 with 15 midwives and representatives from national and international agencies. The Executive Body was formally elected and the Academy for Nursing Studies was selected as Headquarter. The Society was registered on 22nd November,2000 with the Registrars of Society, A.P. with Reg. NO 9701/2000 </p>
