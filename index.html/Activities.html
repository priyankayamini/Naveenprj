                                  <p class="text-dark para">SOMI was a partner along with ANSWERS in the midwifery strengthening project supported by sida. This project helped to bring SOMI fledgling leaders together and develop their capacity to learn, express and advocate. The exposure we received from many interactions helped us to think of a model of midwifery for India</p>
                                <p class="text-dark para">The partnership with UNFPA helped to organize regional workshops in Pune and Kolkata to
                                    disseminate ICM Standards (Basic and Advanced).</p>

                                    <p class="text-dark para">The partnership with IPAS brought the aspects of gender sensitivity and abortion services to our members</p>

                                    <p class="text-dark para">The partnership with UNICEF was taken up for transforming labour rooms under call to action – on site demonstration on and training to improve quality maternal and new born care in the high priority District in West Bengal through labour room reorganization.</p>
                                    <p class="text-dark para">SOMI and IAP partnership helped to strengthen skills of senior nurses in new-born resuscitation and to become national and regional level trainers.</p>
                              <p class="text-dark para">Today we can see the ray of light for strengthening Midwifery for safe motherhood. The “Guidelines on Midwifery Services in India, 2018” has been developed and it is implemented in selected states. This is the result of 24 years journey of SOMI</p>
                             <p class="text-dark para"><b>Partnership for midwifery:</b>SOMI was entered into agreement with White Ribbion Alliance to provide technical support to create an enabling environment for midwifery in India in the year 2021.</p>    
                                    <p class="text-dark para">SOMI in collaboration with WRAI will ensure that NPMs are considered as a specialised cadre with nationally recognized organization. SOMI along with WRAI will ensure their career path way and creation of sufficient positions in the State by state governments to run the MLCUs effectively. SOMI will create awareness of this separate cadre for Midwifery in India with the help from GOI, INC, Ministry of Health and also  from Director of Health Services, Director of Medical Education, Deputy Director of Nursing, Joint Director of Nursing and Registrar of all state governments. SOMI will ensure that all the midwifery educators and midwifery champions are given an opportunity to submit abstracts to present their papers at National and International conferences.

                                    <p class="text-dark para">The Society of Midwives and Himalaya Drug Co for Healthy Mothers and Babies’ collaborated and organized programmes for improving health of mothers and babies during 2018-2019. ANMs were key participants who received inputs from specialists (Midwives, Obstetricians, paediatricians and public health nurses) to enhance their capacity for providing care to mothers and newborns. Both partners gained experience in organizing and sustaining the effort. We also learned what works best for ANMs as field health workers and what benefits women and babies. With this background SOMI wishes to partner with Himalaya Drug Company to improve the quality of health of mothers and babies through programmes organized by ANMs and guided by senior SOMI leaders. It was decided to organize symposium on “Essential New Born Care” to enhance the skill of our ANMs and Midwives.</p>

The logo symbolized the close link between the terms motherhood and midwifery. Women need midwives, and midwives are themselves women.

The midwife-mother relationship centers on the continuous presence and care given by the midwife to the woman throughout her antenatal, childbirth, and postnatal period including early newborn care. SOMI strives to retain this sensitivity of the tradition and demonstrates it through the campaign.

It travelled to 27  cities across  21 states and reached out to thousands of mothers, staff nurses, ANM’s, community health workers and midwives . As the lamp passed from one hand to the other, each Chapter added their own twist to the campaign by coming up with creative ways of reaching the message to the different stakeholders of safe motherhood-  Government, mothers , midwives, media etc..Though each presented their own view of the campaign, they were amazingly united by the flame of the Midwives’ lamp

                        <p class="text-dark para">One in six women who die due to pregnancy-related causes worldwide are from India. A WHO-UNICEF-UNFPA-World Bank report (2010), Trends in maternal mortality 1990-2008, says that 63,000 of the estimated 3,58,000 deaths due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth worldwide occur in India.</p>
                         <p class="text-dark para">Evidence shows that children who lose their mothers are ten times more likely to die before their second birthday, UNFPA (2007).</p>

                        <p class="text-dark para"> “A strong midwifery profession with skilled and sensitive midwives has proved to be crucial for improving maternal health and reducing deaths of mothers and newborns. A key target of MDG 5 is to increase the proportion of deliveries by skilled personnel. India is grappling with acute shortage of skilled nurse-midwives while there is a deluge of institutional deliveries. The best results can be achieved when  nurse midwives are trained to meet the number of deliveries in the hospitals in a safe and sensitive manner."  quotes Dr.Prakasamma, Founder, SOMI and  Founder-Director, Academy for Nursing Studies and Women Empowerment Research Studies(ANSWERS), an organization working on training, research, advocacy  and capacity building of midwives  to improve the maternal and newborn health situation in the Country.</p>

                                <p class="text-dark para">Normal birth occurs naturally via the vagina in almost all mammals on earth, including humans. Nature has facilitated this process. Only about 15% of births become complicated and require assistance or interventions, and less than 10 percent actually require birth through surgery. Being human has changed these figures and placed human babies and mothers at higher risk.  Births through surgery rose to 17.2 % in 2015-16 from 8.5% in 2005-06. Rates are higher the general population compared to the tribal (15.5% versus 9.4% in Gujarat). Rates in urban areas are almost double those in villages (28.3% in urban). </p>

                                    <p class="text-dark para">The common medical reasons for surgical births are large or premature babies, fetal distress, abnormal presentation, non progress of labour, etc. Over the last two decades, human reasons such as impatience, convenience, anxiety and economics have become major factors in higher number of surgical births. Midwives and doctors are aware of the increased risk of morbidity and mortality for mothers and babies when births 

                                        occur through surgery. The dangers are sepsis, wound gaping, low back pain, numbness of extremities, in the mother and asphyxia and late breast feeding in the baby. Added to this is the impediment to bonding and nurturing during this vulnerable period for the mother and baby, and the stress on the family.

                            <p class="text-dark para">The society perceives the need to address gender and profession related challenges that midwives encounter in their work.
                                We advocate for safe, skilled and sensitive care to women, their babies and their families. Our logo depicts our mission. It shows that the mother and her child are a symbiotic whole. They are guarded by the strong, protective and sensitive hands of the midwives.</p>
                                <p class="text-dark para">One of our Objectives is influence policy decisions for safe child birth. Safe Child birth includes during conception to postnal Natal Care. With in this context SOMI celebrates   Brest feeding week every year from 1st to 7th August all over the world..</p>
                                <p class="text-dark para">Evidences shows that Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure child health and survival. However, nearly 2 out of 3 infants are not exclusively breastfed for the recommended 6 months—a rate that has not improved in 2 decades. </p>
                        <p class="text-dark para">Breast milk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. Breast milk provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a child’s nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one third during the second year of life. </p>
                        <p class="text-dark para">Breastfed children perform better on intelligence tests, are less likely to be overweight or obese and less prone to diabetes later in life. Women who breastfeed also have a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers. </p>

The first conference was in Chennai in 2002, and the 16th was in Lucknow in 2023. The conferences have been successful in creating visibility for SOMI and building a national network among SOMI members and other professional organizations. SOMI co-hosted the IX ICM Asia Pacific Midwives conference in November 2009 at Hyderabad along with ANSWERS. This was a milestone in the history of midwifery in India as midwives, midwifery teachers and researchers from 31 countries participated. It gave a tremendous boost to the Indian delegates and showcased how midwives in India could rise to high quality professional standards. The Skill Hall was the highlight of the conference as later other countries also tried to emulate this model. State conferences have also helped in raising awareness and interest among nurse-midwives in India and helped to build partnerships with medical professionals for improving maternal and new born health. SOMI chapters conducted state conferences - Orissa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal. </p>

                    <p class="text-dark para">SOMI executive and members attended ICM congresses at Durban, Glasgow, Prague, Toronto and Bali. These conferences exposed Indian nurse midwives to the high levels of midwifery in certain countries and also helped to build a bond between midwifery leaders in South Asia. The South Asian Midwives‟ Alliance (SAMA) was born out of the mutually recognized need to enable midwives and improvement quality of maternal health. It provided a forum to share aspirations and experiences. The Alliance also paved the way for other agencies to take forward the vision and build regional networks.</p>
